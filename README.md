# Angular Learning Challenge
---

## **Objective**
Recreate components and features from well-known websites using Angular. Focus on mastering Angular concepts, including components, services, routing, state management, and UI/UX design. If backend functionality isn't an option, I'll use mock data or local storage to simulate server interactions.

## **Rules**
1. **Focus on Angular Best Practices:** Use components, services, and routing effectively.
2. **Use Mock Data:** Where server-side functionality is required, simulate data using JSON files, in-memory arrays, or local storage.
3. **Keep It Modular:** Break the application into small, reusable components.
4. **Document Your Work:** Create a short description for each project explaining your approach.
